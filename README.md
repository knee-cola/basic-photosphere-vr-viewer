# What's this?
This is a simple photosphere VR viewer for smartphones.

It's an experiment which involves:
* rendering of a photosphere
* headtracking
* stereoscopic rendering
* using full screen resolution (preventing browser from doing downscaling)

# Demo
Demo is available at: [https://bit.ly/2TOSacT](https://bit.ly/2TOSacT)

This viewer is intended to be used with a Google Cardboard compatible viewer.

Make sure to open it in your smartphone (Chrome or Firefox should we fine).
Tap the screen once to go to fullscreen.

**Note:** the viewer works fine on Samsung Galaxy S5 or similar sized displays.
It might not work so great on larger screens due to the greater distance between center points of each image (due to larger screen). This will hopefully be fixed some day (see *Future roadmap* chapter) 

# Future roadmap
The following features are desired:
* support for different screen sizes
* support for different cardboard boxes (image distortion)
